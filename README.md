As air pollution is a complex mixture of toxic components with considerable impact on humans, forecasting air pollution concentration emerges as a priority for improving life quality. So with the help of Python tools and some Machine Learning algorithms, we try to predict the air quality index.
The dataset contains 1600 examples and 6 columns. The first 5 columns denotes the features on which AQI depends and the last one  stores the Air Quality.
On applying linear regression on the dataset and calculating the values, the accuracy was found to be around 96%
